                Homeless Hounds Animal Rescue exists to ensure the welfare and wellbeing of all animals in need of care.
                We rescue, rehabilitate and rehome at-risk companion animals, and seek to support and promote responsible
                pet ownership and animal welfare.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Whilst cats, dogs and other companion animals are seen by most as our best friends, there are many animals
                who unfortunately end up in situations where they are at-risk and without vital care. Stray and unwanted
                animals regularly end up in shelters or pounds where they can develop behavioural problems and their core
                physical and emotional needs are not met.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                We also recognise that there are times when a responsible pet owner may be temporarily or permanently unable
                to provide appropriate care for their loved ones, such as periods of economic hardship, poor health or unsafe
                living situations.
              </p>
              <p class="mb-4">
                Through our network of animal lovers and dedicated volunteers, we provide a home for animals that come into
                our care, while they receive any veterinary care or behavioural training they may require before we find them
                a forever home. We advocate for animal welfare and responsible pet ownership.
              </p>
              <p>
                We are a volunteer-based not-for-profit organisation registered as a Charity with the Australian Charities
                and Not-For-Profits Commission with DGR status.

              Jake was dumped at a rural pound with the name of "Pig" and the excuse of "I don't want him no more".
              A week later both Jake and I hit the jackpot when we found each other due to the fantastic work of
              Homeless Hounds busting him out of that pound. I originally planned to just foster Jake but I soon
              realised how special this boy was and I couldn't let him go. Over the past nine years Jake has been
              a patient foster brother to around 70 dogs, cats, puppies, and kittens. At 11 years of age he was
              running up to 30km helping me train for a marathon – he was the best running buddy anyone could ask for.
              Jake went from being someone's trash to my absolute treasure.

              The foster mum drove Albert up to me for a meet and greet. Well, here was this lanky, scared puppy
              who had no idea what was going on, at my front door. He came in and, in true doberman style made
              himself at home on my couch. I was so excited, here was this puppy who had a tough couple of months
              and here I was who had also had a tough couple of months. A perfect match. He would become my therapy
              dog, my extra reason to do things. But my world was shattered in a split second. He wouldn't come to
              me at all. Instead, he went straight to my daughter. Obviously he knew she needed him more than I did.
              That was a year ago and best friends they are.

              <p class="text-gray-700 text-sm">
              A while after one of my dogs passed away in late 2014, I began considering getting another dog not
              only because my current little one was very lonely but also because I felt our family needed that
              extra furry member. I reached out to Homeless Hounds and stipulated that I would like another dog
              but it had to be good with other dogs, cats and young children. Not long after, I was contacted by
              Homeless Hounds with a story about a young dog that had been dumped outside a pound in QLD with her
              brother when they were just puppies. The dog's name was Bronte and she had been living at a Homeless
              Hounds foster carer's home for several weeks. Right from that moment she has been such a wonderful,
              caring, loving, affectionate, gentle and energetic dog.
