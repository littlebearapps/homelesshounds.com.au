# Native ASM Integration - Implementation Status

## ‚úÖ Completed (Phases 1-3)

### Phase 1: Infrastructure Setup
- ‚úÖ Created `.dev.vars` with ASM configuration
- ‚úÖ Updated `.gitignore` to exclude sensitive files
- ‚úÖ Created security headers middleware (`functions/_middleware.ts`)
- ‚úÖ Set up proper CSP headers for ASM resources

### Phase 2: API Proxy Layer
- ‚úÖ Created `functions/api/asm/adoptable.ts` - Lists all adoptable animals
  - Supports species filtering (dog/cat/all)
  - Supports pagination (limit/offset)
  - Supports additional filters (agegroup, location)
  - Implements 10-minute caching
- ‚úÖ Created `functions/api/asm/animal/[id].ts` - Single animal details
  - Returns animal data with image URLs
  - Handles not-found cases
  - Generates image sequence URLs

### Phase 3: Data Models
- ‚úÖ Created comprehensive TypeScript interfaces (`src/types/asm.ts`)
  - Complete ASMAnimal interface with all fields
  - API response types
  - Filter types
  - Helper function for slug generation

## üöß Next Steps (Phases 4-5)

### Phase 4: Astro Pages (Next)
The following pages need to be created/updated:

#### 4.1 Update Existing Pages to Use API
**IMPORTANT**: We need to decide whether to:
- Option A: Keep the current JavaScript embed as-is (working solution)
- Option B: Replace with native implementation (better UX but more work)

For native implementation, update these files:
- `src/pages/adopt/index.astro` - Fetch from `/api/asm/adoptable`
- `src/pages/adopt/dogs.astro` - Fetch from `/api/asm/adoptable?species=dog`
- `src/pages/adopt/cats.astro` - Fetch from `/api/asm/adoptable?species=cat`

#### 4.2 Create New Dynamic Route
- `src/pages/adopt/[id]/[slug].astro` - Individual animal detail page
  - Will fetch from `/api/asm/animal/{id}`
  - Display all animal information
  - Image carousel
  - Adoption CTA

### Phase 5: Components
Create reusable components:
- `src/components/AnimalCard.astro` - Card for grid display
- `src/components/AnimalFilters.astro` - Filter dropdowns
- `src/components/ImageCarousel.astro` - For detail pages
- `src/components/AdoptionModal.astro` - Application form modal

## üîß Configuration Required

### ASM Service Account
You need to create a service account in ASM with:
1. Username: `api_service` (or your choice)
2. Password: [secure password]
3. Permission: `VIEW_ANIMAL`
4. Set "Can Login" to NO

Then update `.dev.vars` with the actual credentials.

### Cloudflare Pages Environment Variables
Set these in your Cloudflare Pages dashboard:
- `ASM_ACCOUNT=st3418`
- `ASM_BASE_URL=https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice`
- `ASM_USERNAME=[your service account username]`
- `ASM_PASSWORD=[your service account password]`
- `ASM_ADOPTION_FORM_URL=[form URL]`

## üéØ Decision Points

### 1. Implementation Strategy
**Current Status**: JavaScript embed is working and styled nicely.

**Options**:
- **Keep Current**: Continue with JS embed (less work, already functional)
- **Go Native**: Replace with native pages (more control, better SEO, more work)
- **Hybrid**: Keep listings as JS embed, add native detail pages only

### 2. Testing Approach
The Cloudflare Pages Functions can be tested locally with:
```bash
npx wrangler pages dev ./dist
```

But this requires the ASM credentials to be set up first.

## üìù Notes

### What's Working Now
- The current JavaScript embed solution is functional
- Styling and filters are working well
- Animals are displaying correctly from ASM

### Benefits of Continuing Native Implementation
- Individual animal pages with SEO
- Full control over UI/UX
- Better performance with edge caching
- Native share functionality
- Analytics tracking

### Time Estimate
- Remaining work: 10-15 days (as per plan)
- Could be reduced by keeping current listings and only adding detail pages

## Recommended Next Action

Given that the current JavaScript embed is working well, I recommend:

1. **Keep the current listing pages** (they work and look great)
2. **Add native detail pages only** for SEO benefits
3. **Test the API functions** with real ASM credentials
4. **Gradually migrate** if native approach proves better

This hybrid approach gives you:
- Working solution stays in place
- SEO benefits from individual animal pages
- Lower risk and effort
- Option to fully migrate later if desired
