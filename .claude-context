## üîñ Session Continuity

### Last Session Summary
**VOLUNTEER ENGAGEMENT SYSTEM ENHANCED**: Complete redesign of volunteer page with modern UI including accordion-style opportunity listings, 2-column layout for Getting Started/Benefits sections, integrated Code of Conduct, and improved CTA section. Created Privacy Policy page from WordPress content. Updated homepage adoption buttons to match /adopt page style with category navigation. Removed outdated Goodwill Wines references. All pages now feature consistent modern design language with gradients, rounded corners, shadow effects, and responsive layouts. Accordion implementation provides better UX for volunteer opportunities with always-visible key information and expandable details.

### Key Implementation Details
```typescript
// Universal form submission with Turnstile
/api/submit - handles all ASM forms with spam protection

// Form schema with fallback parsing  
/api/asm/form-schema?formid=37 - JSON schema from ASM API

// Form ID mapping corrected:
37: Animal surrender ‚úÖ (with email notifications)
36: Volunteer registration (next)
39: Adoption application (corrected ID, next)
38: Foster application (to be removed per user request)

// Conditional Turnstile integration
if (TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY && TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY !== '') {
  // Verify token
}
```

### Environment State
- Branch: `main`
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages
- ASM Account: st3418
- ASM Service Account: `api_service_account` (no-login)
- Animals in system: 2 currently adoptable (Spike & Kodi)

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Actions

### Next Session Priority
1. **Volunteer registration form** - Copy surrender form pattern to /contact-us/volunteer/ with form ID 36 + email notifications
2. **Adoption application form** - Create /adopt/apply/[petId] with form ID 39 + email notifications
3. **Remove foster care form references** - Clean up TODO comments per user request
4. **General contact form** - Simple contact form without ASM integration

### Future Sessions
1. Payment integration for donations (Stripe/PayPal)
2. Enhanced email templates for volunteer/adoption flows
3. Performance optimization and monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Context

### ASM Integration Notes
- API credentials stored in Cloudflare Pages env vars (encrypted)
- Local development uses `.env` file with same variables
- API endpoints updated with fallback: `locals?.runtime?.env?.VAR || import.meta.env.VAR`
- Using dedicated `api_service_account` with "Can Login: NO" for security
- Forms can use `online_form_json` for schema
- Submit to `online_form_html` for processing
- Cache form schemas for performance

### Proposed Forms Architecture
- Use Cloudflare Pages Functions for backend
- Turnstile for anti-spam protection  
- Native form rendering from ASM JSON
- Proper CSP headers for security
- Thank you page redirects

### Security Considerations
- Never expose ASM credentials to client
- Use server-side form validation
- Implement rate limiting
- Add CSP headers for XSS protection

## üí≠ Session Notes

The native ASM integration is a major improvement over JavaScript embeds:
- Better SEO (server-rendered content)
- Faster initial page loads
- More control over styling and UX
- Improved accessibility
- Real-time data without iframe issues

The proposed forms system looks excellent - well-architected with proper security (Turnstile), caching, and native rendering. This will complete the transition away from JavaScript embeds.
