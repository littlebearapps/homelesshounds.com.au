## üîñ Session Continuity

### Last Session Summary
Successfully implemented native ASM integration for all adoption pages. Replaced JavaScript embeds with server-side rendered components using Astro SSR. Fixed environment variable access patterns for Cloudflare Pages. All 20 animals (dogs and cats) now display with native components, filters, and SEO-friendly URLs.

### Key Implementation Details
```typescript
// Environment variable access pattern for Cloudflare Pages
const ASM_ACCOUNT = locals?.runtime?.env?.ASM_ACCOUNT;

// SSR enabled for dynamic content
export const prerender = false;

// API endpoints
/api/asm/adoptable?species=[all|dog|cat]
/api/asm/animal/[id]
```

### Environment State
- Branch: `main`  
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages
- ASM Account: st3418
- Animals in system: 20 total

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Actions

### Immediate (This Session)
1. Review and implement native forms proposal
2. Set up Cloudflare Turnstile for spam protection
3. Create surrender form with ASM integration

### Next Session Priority
1. Adoption application form
2. Volunteer/foster forms
3. Payment integration for donations

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Context

### ASM Integration Notes
- API credentials stored in Cloudflare Pages env vars (encrypted)
- Forms can use `online_form_json` for schema
- Submit to `online_form_html` for processing
- Cache form schemas for performance

### Proposed Forms Architecture
- Use Cloudflare Pages Functions for backend
- Turnstile for anti-spam protection  
- Native form rendering from ASM JSON
- Proper CSP headers for security
- Thank you page redirects

### Security Considerations
- Never expose ASM credentials to client
- Use server-side form validation
- Implement rate limiting
- Add CSP headers for XSS protection

## üí≠ Session Notes

The native ASM integration is a major improvement over JavaScript embeds:
- Better SEO (server-rendered content)
- Faster initial page loads
- More control over styling and UX
- Improved accessibility
- Real-time data without iframe issues

The proposed forms system looks excellent - well-architected with proper security (Turnstile), caching, and native rendering. This will complete the transition away from JavaScript embeds.
