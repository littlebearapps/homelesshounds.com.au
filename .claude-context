## üìö Key References

**Project Structure**:
- Pages: `src/pages/adopt/` (native ASM)
- Components: `src/components/AnimalCard.astro`, `AnimalFilters.astro`
- API Routes: `src/pages/api/asm/`
- Functions: `functions/api/` (proposed)

**Live Sites**:
- Production: https://homelesshounds-com-au.pages.dev
- ASM API: https://service.sheltermanager.com/asmservice

## üîñ Session Continuity

### Last Session Summary
**API FIX COMPLETE**: Fixed critical ASM API authentication issue preventing adoption pages from loading. The problem was that API endpoints only checked Cloudflare runtime environment variables, not local development variables. Added fallback to `import.meta.env` for local development and configured the `api_service_account` (no-login service account) for secure API-only access. All adoption pages now working with live animal data.

### Key Implementation Details
```typescript
// Universal form submission with Turnstile
/api/submit - handles all ASM forms with spam protection

// Form schema with fallback parsing  
/api/asm/form-schema?formid=37 - JSON schema from ASM API

// Form ID mapping working:
37: Animal surrender ‚úÖ
36: Volunteer registration (next)
38: Adoption application (next) 
39: Foster care application (next)

// Conditional Turnstile integration
if (TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY && TURNSTILE_SECRET_KEY !== '') {
  // Verify token
}
```

### Environment State
- Branch: `main`
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages
- ASM Account: st3418
- ASM Service Account: `api_service_account` (no-login)
- Animals in system: 2 currently adoptable (Spike & Kodi)

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Actions

### Next Session Priority
1. **Volunteer registration form** - Copy surrender form pattern to /contact-us/volunteer/ with form ID 36
2. **Adoption application form** - Create /adopt/apply/[petId] with form ID 38
3. **Foster care application** - Create /get-involved/foster-care/ with form ID 39
4. **General contact form** - Simple contact form without ASM integration

### Future Sessions
1. Payment integration for donations (Stripe/PayPal)
2. Email notification system enhancements  
3. Performance optimization and monitoring

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Context

### ASM Integration Notes
- API credentials stored in Cloudflare Pages env vars (encrypted)
- Local development uses `.env` file with same variables
- API endpoints updated with fallback: `locals?.runtime?.env?.VAR || import.meta.env.VAR`
- Using dedicated `api_service_account` with "Can Login: NO" for security
- Forms can use `online_form_json` for schema
- Submit to `online_form_html` for processing
- Cache form schemas for performance

### Proposed Forms Architecture
- Use Cloudflare Pages Functions for backend
- Turnstile for anti-spam protection  
- Native form rendering from ASM JSON
- Proper CSP headers for security
- Thank you page redirects

### Security Considerations
- Never expose ASM credentials to client
- Use server-side form validation
- Implement rate limiting
- Add CSP headers for XSS protection

## üí≠ Session Notes

The native ASM integration is a major improvement over JavaScript embeds:
- Better SEO (server-rendered content)
- Faster initial page loads
- More control over styling and UX
- Improved accessibility
- Real-time data without iframe issues

The proposed forms system looks excellent - well-architected with proper security (Turnstile), caching, and native rendering. This will complete the transition away from JavaScript embeds.
