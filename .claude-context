## üîñ Session Continuity

### Last Session Summary
**ALL VOLUNTEER FORMS ACTIVE**: Completed implementation of all volunteer application forms with modal interfaces. Fixed critical bug where duplicate IDs prevented cat foster modal from opening. Converted FAQs to accordion format on foster and pet courier pages for better UX. All forms now feature auto-save, section-based layouts, dynamic field generation from ASM, and proper thank you pages. Consistent color scheme (orange for animals, teal for foster, indigo for couriers) across all forms.

### Key Implementation Details
```typescript
// Form ID mapping complete:
37: Animal surrender ‚úÖ (with email notifications)
38: Dog adoption ‚úÖ (modal ready)
39: Cat adoption ‚úÖ (modal ready)
67: Pet courier ‚úÖ (modal active)
68: Dog foster ‚úÖ (modal active)
69: Cat foster ‚úÖ (modal active)
36: Volunteer registration (next)

// Modal ID fix for multiple forms:
id={`foster-fields-${species}`} // Unique IDs per species
id={`form-header-${species}`}

// Accordion implementation:
function toggleAccordion(id) {
  const content = document.getElementById(id + '-content');
  const icon = document.getElementById(id + '-icon');
  // Toggle visibility and rotate icon
}
```

### Environment State
- Branch: `main`
- Deployment: Cloudflare Pages
- ASM Account: st3418
- ASM Service Account: `api_service_account` (no-login)
- SendGrid: Configured with domain auth and webhooks

## ‚è≠Ô∏è Next Actions

### Next Session Priority
1. **Volunteer registration form** - Create modal for form ID 36
2. **Test all forms** - End-to-end testing in production
3. **Performance optimization** - Lazy load modals, optimize API calls
4. **Documentation update** - Update user guides for all forms

### Future Sessions
1. Payment integration for donations (Stripe/PayPal)
2. Enhanced email templates for all form types
3. Analytics and conversion tracking
4. Admin dashboard for form submissions

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Context

### ASM Integration Notes
- All forms use modal pattern for consistency
- Auto-save functionality prevents data loss
- Section-based layouts improve form completion
- Dynamic field generation from ASM API
- Turnstile protection on all forms

### Modal Architecture
- Each modal has unique IDs to prevent conflicts
- Global functions for opening modals (e.g., `openDogFosterModal()`)
- localStorage for form persistence (7-day expiry)
- Responsive design with max-height constraints
- Thank you pages with personalization

### Security Considerations
- Server-side form validation
- Turnstile anti-spam protection
- Email verification via SendGrid
- Webhook signature validation
- CSP headers for XSS protection

## üí≠ Session Notes

The modal-based form system provides excellent UX:
- No page navigation required
- Auto-save prevents frustration
- Section-based layout reduces cognitive load
- Immediate feedback on submission
- Consistent experience across all forms

Key learning: Always ensure unique IDs when multiple similar components exist on same page. The cat foster modal bug was caused by both modals using identical element IDs.
